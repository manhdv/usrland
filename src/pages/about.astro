    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Usrland is a personal notespace.
    </p>

    <p>
      I go by <strong>Mage</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I write about things I actually use and break:
      Linux, Debian, self-hosting, packaging, tooling, and the occasional hack.
    </p>

    <p>
      No growth hacks. No tutorials for beginners.
      Just field notes from messing with systems long enough to know where they crack.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it works, it stays. If it breaks, it gets documented.
    </p>
